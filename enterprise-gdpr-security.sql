-- ENTERPRISE GDPR-COMPLIANT SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION
-- =====================================================
-- This script ensures complete data isolation and GDPR compliance
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor to activate enterprise-grade security

-- 1. VERIFY ALL CRITICAL TABLES HAVE RLS ENABLED
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS properties ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS units ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS leases ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS payments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS maintenance_tickets ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. DROP EXISTING POLICIES TO ENSURE CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION
