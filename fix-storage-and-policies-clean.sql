-- =====================================================
-- FIX STORAGE SECURITY AND MISSING POLICIES
-- =====================================================
-- This script fixes the storage security and policy issues identified
-- Run this after connect-existing-tables-fixed.sql

-- 1. FIX STORAGE BUCKET SECURITY
-- First, let's check what storage buckets exist
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  public,
  CASE 
    WHEN public = false THEN '✅ SECURE'
    ELSE '❌ PUBLIC'
  END as security_status
FROM storage.buckets;

-- Create secure tenant-documents bucket if it doesn't exist
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('tenant-documents', 'tenant-documents', false)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET public = false;

-- Create secure documents bucket if it doesn't exist
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('documents', 'documents', false)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET public = false;

-- 2. CREATE STORAGE POLICIES FOR TENANT-DOCUMENTS BUCKET
-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Tenants can upload to their own folder" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Tenants can view their own documents in storage" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Landlords can view tenant documents in storage" ON storage.objects;

-- Tenants can only upload to their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Tenants can upload to their own folder"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'tenant-documents' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Tenants can only view their own documents in storage
CREATE POLICY "Tenants can view their own documents in storage"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'tenant-documents' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Landlords can view documents from their tenants in storage
CREATE POLICY "Landlords can view tenant documents in storage"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'tenant-documents' AND
    (storage.foldername(name))[1] IN (
      SELECT t.id::text FROM users t
      JOIN leases l ON t.id = l.tenant_id
      JOIN units u ON l.unit_id = u.id
      JOIN properties p ON u.property_id = p.id
      WHERE p.owner_id = auth.uid() OR p.landlord_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- 3. CREATE STORAGE POLICIES FOR DOCUMENTS BUCKET
-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload documents" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view documents" ON storage.objects;

-- Users can upload documents to the documents bucket
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload documents"

-- Users can view documents they have access to
CREATE POLICY "Users can view documents"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'documents' AND
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
  );

-- 4. VERIFY AND CREATE MISSING TABLE POLICIES
-- Check what policies exist on critical tables
SELECT 
  tablename,
  COUNT(*) as existing_policies
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('documents', 'payments', 'maintenance_tickets', 'leases')
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;

-- 5. CREATE MISSING DOCUMENTS TABLE POLICIES
-- Drop existing policies if they exist

CREATE POLICY "Users can update documents they created"
  ON documents FOR UPDATE
  USING (created_by = auth.uid());

-- 6. CREATE MISSING PAYMENTS TABLE POLICIES
-- Drop existing policies if they exist

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Landlords can manage payments for their properties" ON payments;

-- Tenants can view their own payments
CREATE POLICY "Tenants can view their own payments"

      WHERE p.owner_id = auth.uid() OR p.landlord_id = auth.uid()
    )

-- 9. VERIFICATION - Check if all issues are fixed
-- Verify storage buckets are secure
SELECT

  CASE 
    WHEN (
